## Config / setup

The workshops all use jupyter notebooks.

There is a vscode workspace, with a devcontainer configured to work with python/jupyter.

What you will need to add is a .env file with the necessary variables/values to invoke LLMs like OpenAI/groq and whatever other platform a particular talk/jupyter notebook is using.
